# AI-Reinforcement-Learning-Projects
This repository serves as a collection of all the projects and concepts I took part in during CSE 150B Artificial Intelligence: Search and Reasoning at UC San Diego. The primary language used in these implementations was Python, and unit testing in Pytest. 

Due to University restrictions, the implementations of these projects cannot be shown to reduce the risk of potential AI violations. All project code can be showcased upon request.

## Graph Search

### DFS

### BFS

### Uniform Cost Search

### A* Search

## 2048 AI

## Black Jack AI

## Gomoku AI

## Sudoku AI

## Future Work  
In addition to these previously implemented models, I plan to use the knowledge and skills gained in this class to construct a Chess move recommendation assistant. Furthermore, I plan to potentially explore research topics in inverse planning, adversarial/deceptive planning, and strategic obfuscation within reinforcement learning agents
